# Git and GitHub

Get familiar with Git and GitHub.

 1. Finish the course [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

    You may resort to subtitles/closed captions and
    to auto-translated subtitles in particular if you feel
    it would help you to master the video course better.

 2. Complete the following levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):
    - Main: Introduction Sequence
    - Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes

 3. Create repository named `kottans-frontend`.

 4. Create `README.md` for the repository.

 5. Describe your impressions about learned materials.

 6. Send a pull-request to [Kottans/mock-repo][mock-repo] proposing a change.
    It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great!
    Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.

    **Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.**
