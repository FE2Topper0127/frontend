# Building a Tiny JS World

1. Build a tiny JS world model following the instructions
   [here](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world).
   
At this stage you are required to complete only **First approach** part.
You will revert to your Tiny JS World to improve it later.
So, for now restrict yourself to the means you feel confident with.

When complete do the following:
1. You will require code review for this task:
   * publish your task code base (`index.js` only) for review following instructions
     in [FE 2019 course homewroks repo](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks)
   * post a link to your task PR in the
     [FE Questionarium chat](https://t.me/joinchat/DmX0JAl-mh5W0jrWli8Ycw)
     and ask mentors for a code review
   * once the code review phase successfully finished
     and you have an approval from one of the mentors
     add to your `kottans-frontend/README.md`
     the header `## A Tiny JS World`,
     a link to the task code base and
     a note saying `Reviewed and approved by @<mentor>`
     (use mentor's github username)
   * list your reflections on this task
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `A Tiny JS World — #done` and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Read one or two articles on OOP under the links in
   [this repo](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world/blob/master/README.md#learn-on-your-own)

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.

## Done?

➡️ Go forward to [Object-Oriented JavaScript](js-oop.md)
