# Friends App

When you're done with your challenge push your code to github repo and publish
it using `gh-pages`. _Add link to it to your main frontend tasks repo._

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others - send a message in [course channel](chat) with the link to you repo and the words "Friends APP - finished" and add link to repo with code of the
website.

## Friends app

Create a tiny social friends' search page with users cards, search, sorting and filtering of them by age, name or whatewer you want with [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) :)

### As a user, I would like to:

* see cards list of users on the page, cards may be pretty styled with user photo, name, age, phone number, maybe with some another user information which you would to see in user info card.
* searching by typing name in search input and see immediately filtering on the page
* sorting cards by name/age in A-Z/Z-A ways
* filtering friends by age, by name, whatever you want else options

- [ ] you can use all `Array.methods` which you know :) for instance - Array.sort (text sort, number sort) `/filter/slice/splice/shift/map/reduce`
- [ ] you can try to figure out with async data incapsulation in request/response and try callbacks' logic in action
- [ ] understand sync/async `GET request`, params & queries in action, something one of `axios/fetch/xhr/` but NOT jQuery.
- [ ] understand pros & cons of the immutable fundamentals for complex types aka array on example of copies of arrays and how manage them
- [ ] you can try form' key/mouse events, manage them, enable and disable them

### Stuff which will help you:

* [–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã XMLHttpRequest](https://learn.javascript.ru/ajax-xmlhttprequest) - you
  can use XMLHttpRequest for sending requests to webserver;
  [Method Fetch –∑–∞–º–µ–Ω–∞ XHR](https://learn.javascript.ru/fetch) - you can use fetch as better tool for sending requests.
* [Randomuser api with awesome simple examples and docs](https://randomuser.me) -
  _you can use one of this API for getting data for your website_;
* [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) - you can use
  this for working with URL;
* Take a look on [Array methods on learn.javascript.ru](https://learn.javascript.ru/array-methods)
* make good responsive/adaptive/fluid/elastic/whatever design with your styles as you imagine.
