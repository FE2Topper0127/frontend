# Friends App

Create a tiny social friends' search page with users cards,
search, sorting and filtering of them by age, name
or whatever you want with [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) :)

## Example

This is an *example*. You should style your application like you want.

Make it personal. Make it beautiful. Make it perfect and then be proud for what you did.

Complete the user stories below.

## As a user, I would like to

* see cards list of users on the page, cards may be pretty styled with user photo, name, age, phone number, maybe with some another user information which you would to see in user info card.
* searching by typing name in search input and see immediately filtering on the page
* sorting cards by name/age in A-Z/Z-A ways
* filtering friends by age, by name, whatever you want else options
* see fancy icons and cool design with shadows, gradients, yellow font on the blue background, etc. Usage of template absolutely acceptable

## If you feel that you can do a better job, you can

Note, that this is an additional part of the task. Also you can implement anything from the list below.

### Be like a Durov and

* add pagination to scrolling
* sort not only by name and age, but also by date of registration
* filter by location and email
* make good responsive/fluid/elastic/whatever design which will work for mobiles
* use async/awaits for handling async actions

### Be like a Zuckerberg and

* add support of address bar which means, that user must see a state of filters and sortings in URL
* using your OOP knowledge, split your application to different parts, like: `FriendsList`, `FiltersContainer`, etc.
* with help of ES6 modules build website based on frontend components

## You can

* use all `Array.methods` which you know :)
* try to figure out with async data encapsulation in request/response. Try callbacks' logic in action
* understand difference between synchronous and asynchronous network requests
* get know params & queries in action
* use `fetch` and/or `XMLHttpRequest`. But *NOT* jQuery. Bad jQuery, bad! No ones like jQuery! `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
* understand pros & cons of the immutable data fundamentals on example of copies of arrays
* try form' key/mouse events, manage them, enable and disable them

## Stuff which will help you

* We think that you will need to use promises for this task ;)
* [–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã XMLHttpRequest](https://learn.javascript.ru/xmlhttprequest) - you
  can use `XMLHttpRequest` for sending requests to webserver;
  [Method Fetch –∑–∞–º–µ–Ω–∞ XHR](https://learn.javascript.ru/fetch) - you can use `fetch` as better tool for sending requests.
* [Randomuser api with awesome simple examples and docs](https://randomuser.me) -
  _you can use one of this API for getting data for your website_;
* [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) - you can use
  this for working with URL;
* Take a look on [Array methods on learn.javascript.ru](https://learn.javascript.ru/array-methods) and on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
* [Manipulating the browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) -
  you must know how to work with browser history.

When you're done with your challenge push your code to GitHub repo and publish
it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

When complete do the following:
1. You will require code review for this task:
   - For **Frontend 2021** course students: please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2021-homeworks/blob/master/README.md)
   - For **p2p course** students: please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-p2p/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others ‚Äì
   post a message in the [course channel][chat]:
   `Friends App ‚Äî #done` (or `Friends App ‚Äî #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
