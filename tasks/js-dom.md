# Document Object Model

### Learn some frontend basics about DOM API:

1. [JavaScript and the DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117)
   (4 lessons, estimated completion time 8 hrs)

1. [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)
   - finish the second half of the course (10 lessons) and save a screenshot.

### .then():

1. **Practical task**: Implement interactive side-menu' site without page reloads. You may choose any theme: pokemons, phones, site pages aka about/prices/goal/etc.
   Action menu - something like this but not so ugly :)

### The goal

Main goal - menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned `<main>` content container.

### Goals ###

- [ ] complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
- [ ] you can store data in an array of objects
- [ ] you can use `innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener`,
- [ ] you may find usefull array methods as `Array#filter`, `Array#sort`, `Array#find`, etc.
- [ ] and of course - DOM methods.

You may want to publish your results on
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_js_basics` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. You will require code review for your subtask (3).
   Check [code review guidelines](code-review.md) for details.
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## DOM`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * add link to subtask (3) code base
   * when you have your code reviewed by a mentor add a note
     `Reviewed and approved by @<mentor>` using mentor's
     github username
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `DOM - finished!` and add the link to your repo
1. Code review:
   - post link to your subtask (3) code base in the
     [FE Questionarium chat](https://t.me/joinchat/DmX0JAl-mh5W0jrWli8Ycw)
     and ask mentors for a code review
   - once the code review phase successfully finished
     and you have an approval from one of the mentors
     add a note to `kottans-frontend/README.md` beside your code base link
     saying `Reviewed and approved by @<mentor>`
     (use mentor's github username)
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
