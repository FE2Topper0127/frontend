# Document Object Model

Learn some frontend basics: DOM API

- [JavaScript and the DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117)
(4 lessons, estimated completion time 8 hrs)
- [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) - finish second half of the course (10 lessons) and save a screenshot.
- **Practical task**: Implement interactive side-menu' site without page reloads aka simple SPA. Theme may be any: pokemons, phones, site pages aka about/prices/goal/etc.
Action menu - something like this but not so ugly :)

**‎Goals**:

- [ ] complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
- [ ] the point is the action-driven menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned `<main>` content container
- [ ] you can store data in array of objects
- [ ] you can use `innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement`, container listeners
- [ ] you can use `Array.filter/sort/find/findIndex/reduce/map` etc and of course - DOM methods.
You can push your code to separated repo, push it to gh-pages or whatever you want to publish your practical task. Good luck!

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others — post a message to [course channel][chat] with the link to your repo
and the words _DOM – finished_.

When you finish this task you can start the next one.
