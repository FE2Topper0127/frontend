# Document Object Model

### Learn some frontend basics about DOM API:

1. [JavaScript and the DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117)
   (4 lessons, estimated completion time 8 hrs)

2. [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)
   - finish tasks 12..18 (**Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers** to **Everything Be True**) and save a screenshot.

### .then():

3. **Practical task**: Implement interactive side-menu' site without page reloads. You may choose any theme: pokemons, phones, site pages aka about/prices/goal/etc.
   Action menu - something like this but not so ugly :)

### The goal

Main goal - menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned `<main>` content container.

### Goals ###

- [ ] complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
- [ ] you can store data in an array of objects
- [ ] you can use `innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener`,
- [ ] you may find useful array methods as `Array#filter`, `Array#sort`, `Array#find`, etc.
- [ ] and of course - DOM methods.

You may want to publish your results on
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_js_dom` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## DOM`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `DOM — #done` (or `DOM — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. You will require code review for your subtask (3):
   - If you are a **p2p course** student, please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-p2p/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - If you are a student of the **offline** Kottans course, please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks/blob/master/README.md)
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

You have completed **Front-End basics** tasks section. We shall appreciate your feedback on this section especially if you're doing this course from Ukraine. Please, grant us 10-15 minutes of your time and complete [this feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/qht9CEw7E966wXcl1).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
