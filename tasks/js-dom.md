# Document Object Model

### Learn some frontend basics about DOM API:

- [JavaScript and the DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117)
(4 lessons, estimated completion time 8 hrs)
- [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) - finish second half of the course (10 lessons) and save a screenshot.

### .then():

- **Practical task**: Implement interactive side-menu' site without page reloads. You may choose any theme: pokemons, phones, site pages aka about/prices/goal/etc.
Action menu - something like this but not so ugly :)

### The goal###

Main goal - menu with ability to load some predefined html content related to own menu item into right-positioned `<main>` content container.

### Goals ###

- [ ] complex implementation of full page responsive layout (credit to Udacity course about responsive HTML/CSS).
- [ ] you can store data in an array of objects
- [ ] you can use `innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener`, 
- [ ] you may find usefull array methods as `Array#filter`, `Array#sort`, `Array#find`, etc. 
- [ ] and of course - DOM methods.
You can push your code to a separated repo, push it to gh-pages or whatever you want to publish your practical task. Good luck!

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others — post a message to [course channel][chat] with the link to your repo
and the words _DOM – finished_.

When you finish this task you can start the next one.
