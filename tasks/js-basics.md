# JavaScript Basics

1. [Intro to JS](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)

1. [freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)
   - finish first half of the course (11 lessons) and save a screenshot
   - note that for _Intermediate Algorithms Scripting: **Pig Latin**_ exercise English letter **Y** is considered a consonant
   - use hints available on freecodecamp at each exercise as the first resort when you feel stuck

Finish the subtasks (1) and (2) above.

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_js_basics` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## JS Basics`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `JS Basics — #done` and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
