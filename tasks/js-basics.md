# JavaScript Basics

1. [Intro to JS](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803)

1. FreeCodeCamp exercises. Complete the modules below and save screenshots for each module.
   Use hints available on freecodecamp at each exercise as the first resort when you feel stuck.
   Other helpful devices are materials from **Extra Materials** section below
   and students chat to ask any questions and seek for help.
   - [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/) -
     Basic JavaScript language features. ~100 tiny exercises, 2-3 hrs to complete.
   - [ES6 Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/) -
     JS ES6 features. Complete initial 19 exercises (till **Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6**),
     3-4 hrs to complete.
   - [Basic Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/) -
     Manipulate arrays and objects. Complete all exercises (20). 3-4 hrs to complete.
   - [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/) -
     Basic algorithms. Solve all problems (<20). 4-5 hrs to complete.
   - [Functional Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/) -
     Complete all exercises (<25). 2-3 hrs to complete.
   - [Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) -
     Intermediate algorithms. Solve initial 11 problems (till **Convert HTML Entities**), 3-5 hrs to complete.
     - :warning: In [**Pig Latin**](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/pig-latin/)
       exercise English letter **Y** is considered a consonant.
     - :warning: In [**Convert HTML Entities**](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/convert-html-entities)
       exercise **DO NOT** copy-paste HTML entities (`'&amp;'`, `'&lt'` etc.) from the tests
       as those will contain invisible non-breaking spaces and the code won't work as expected. Type them instead.

Finish the subtasks (1) and (2) above.

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_js_basics` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## JS Basics`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `JS Basics — #done` (or `JS Basics — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
