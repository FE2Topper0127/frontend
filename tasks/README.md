### New tasks suggested for the remote phase

These below can be added to the course only
if approved by the community.

* [pre-OOP JS](js-pre-oop.md) -
  would come before [Object-Oriented JavaScript](js-oop.md)
  to give students some experience of possibly bad coding.
  Time to complete estimate 1-2 hours.
