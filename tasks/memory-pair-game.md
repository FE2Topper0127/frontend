# Memory – Pair Game

We learned a lot, but now let's do some practice!

In this section you will create _Memory - Pair Game_ — a card game in which
all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped
face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs
of matching cards. The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.

In order to complete this challenge you should have a basic knowledge of
HTML, CSS and JS. You can use any styling and animations you want —
the only rule is to do it by yourself.

Some of following links might be helpful:

1. [Shuffle Array](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/shuffle-array/)
1. [CSS3 Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)
1. [Flip Animation](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip)

When you're done with your challenge push your code to GitHub repo and publish
it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

When complete do the following:
1. You will require code review for this task:
   * publish your task code base for review following instructions
     in [FE 2019 course homeworks repo](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks)
   * when creating a PR do not forget to add a link
     to your game published on GitHub Pages
   * post links to your game on GitHub Pages and
     to your task PR in the
     [FE Questionarium chat](https://t.me/joinchat/DmX0JAl-mh5W0jrWli8Ycw)
     and ask mentors for a code review
   * once the code review phase successfully finished
     and you have an approval from one of the mentors
     add to your `kottans-frontend/README.md`
     the header `## Memory Pair Game`,
     a link to the game on GitHub Pages,
     a link to the task code base and
     a note saying `Reviewed and approved by @<mentor>`
     (use mentor's github username)
   * list your reflections on this task
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in the [course channel][chat]:
   `Memory Pair Game — #done` and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
