# Memory – Pair Game

We learned a lot, but now lets do some practice!

In this section you will create _Memory - Pair Game_ — a card game in which
all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped
face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs
of matching cards. The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.

In order to complete this challenge you should have a basic knowledge of
HTML, CSS and JS. You can use any styling and animations you want —
the only rule is to do it by yourself.

Some of following links might be helpful:

1. [Shuffle Array](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/shuffle-array/)
2. [CSS3 Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)

When you're done with your challenge push your code to GitHub repo and publish
it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
Add link to your main frontend tasks repo.

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others — post a message to [course channel][chat] with the link to your repo
and the words _Memory - Pair Game – finished_.
