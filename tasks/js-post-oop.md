# OOP exercise

Now you know a lot about JavaScript OOP. Remember that
tiny JS world? Time to use your new power.

1. Re-build your tiny JS world model you forked from
   [here](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world).
   This time use your favourite JS OOP methods to keep
   your code DRY and SOLID.

2. When done then do the following

   * in your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md` add a header
     **post-OOP JS**, add the link to your repo and also
     - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
     - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
     - name (at least) one thing you intend to use in the future
     - how OOP course you passed affected your coding

   * share your progress with others -
     send a message in gitter channel (_post-OOP JS task finished!_)
     with the link to your
     repo and `@/all` tag and also ask mentors to make
     a code review

## Done?
