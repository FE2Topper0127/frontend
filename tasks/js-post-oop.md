# OOP exercise

Now you know a lot about JavaScript OOP. Remember that
tiny JS world? Time to use your new power.

1. Improve your tiny JS world model you forked from
   [here](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world).
   This time use your favourite JS OOP methods to keep
   your code DRY and SOLID.

   You don't need forking this time, work with the repo you've
   already got. Git keeps history for you.

When complete do the following:
1. You will require code review for this task:
   - If you are a **p2p course** student, please,
   follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-p2p/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - If you are a student of the **offline** Kottans course, please,
   follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks/blob/master/README.md)
   - Note, that especially this task requires you to submit
   a single file (`index.js` **only**) to the
   `frontend-2019-homeworks` or `frontend-2019-p2p` repo for code review.
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `OOP Exercise — #done` (or `OOP Exercise — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student)
   and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills and
   read an article or two on OOP under the links in
   [this repo](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world/blob/master/README.md#learn-on-your-own)
