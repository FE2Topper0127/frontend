# OOP exercise

Now you know a lot about JavaScript OOP. Remember that
tiny JS world? Time to use your new power.

1. Improve your tiny JS world model you forked from
   [here](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko/a-tiny-JS-world).
   This time use your favourite JS OOP methods to keep
   your code DRY and SOLID.

   You don't need forking this time, work with the repo you've
   already got. Git keeps history for you.

2. When done then do the following

   * in your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md` add a header
     **post-OOP JS**, add the link to your repo and also
     - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
     - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
     - name (at least) one thing you intend to use in the future
     - how OOP course you passed affected your coding

   * share your progress with others -
     post a message in [course channel][chat]
     with the link to your repo, words _OOP exercise - finished!_,
     and also ask mentors to make a code review
