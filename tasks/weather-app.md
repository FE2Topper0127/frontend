# Weather App

When you're done with your challenge push your code to github repo and publish
it using `gh-pages`. _Add link to it to your main frontend tasks repo._

If you honestly finished all the previous steps than go ahead and share it with
others - send a message in [course channel](chat) with the link to you repo and the words "Weather APP - finished" and add link to repo with code of the
website.

## Weather app

Create a page with a weather cast. As example, you can see forecast from
[darksky](https://darksky.net/forecast/50.4501,30.5241/us12/en).

### As a user, I would like to:

* enter the name of a city and get the forecast for it;
* see forecast for some period, not only for today. As example, for
  tomorrow, week, two weeks, etc;
* choose units ‚Äî Celsius or Fahrenheit;
* have a list of favorite cities. By selecting favorite city from the list, I
  want to see forecast in it;
* have a list of recently viewed cities;
* see current city or latitude and longitude in the link in the address bar of
  the browser. If I open this link in the new window, website must show me
  weather in this city;
* see fancy icons for forecast and design. Usage of template absolutely
  acceptable.

You must support only last versions of major browsers ‚Äî Chrome, Safari, FF,
Edge.

If you wish, you can support Internet Explorer, but this is not required. Same
story with mobile devices.

### Stuff which will help you:

* [–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã XMLHttpRequest](https://learn.javascript.ru/ajax-xmlhttprequest) - you
  can use XMLHttpRequest for sending requests to webserver;
* [Weather public API's](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#weather) -
  _you can use one of this API for getting data for your website_;
* [URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) - you can use
  this for working with URL;
* [Manipulating the browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) -
  you must know how to work with browser history.

### If you feel that you can do a better job, you can:

#### Choose path of master of sun and clouds, and:

* use
  [async/awaits](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-from-callbacks-to-async-await-1cc090ddad99)
  and [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
  for handling network requests;
* with help of ES6 modules build website based on frontend components (aware,
  that FF do not support ES6 modules right now).
* make good responsive/fluid/elastic/whatever design and other modern stuff;

#### Choose path of grandmaster of storms, tornadoes for all over the time, space and in all possible far-far away, and:

* see video, which will give basic understanding about architecture of modern
  website ‚Äî
  [Nicholas Zakas: Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXjVFPosQHw);
* after finishing above mentioned video, try to build your website from
  components. As example:

  - Application ‚Äî fetching, storing and processing all the data
  - SearchBar ‚Äî controls search input, sends input data to Application
  - TodayForecast ‚Äî takes data from Application and shows forecast for today
  - WeekForecast ‚Äî takes data from Application and shows forecast for week
  - TemperatureDropdown ‚Äî dropdown, which gives possibility to select Celsius or
    Fahrenheit

### Additional information

* The exact list of forecast periods may depend on API which you choose for this
  task. Providing forecast not for week, but for five days, 10 days, etc.
  totally acceptable;
* In case you try to build modular frontend application, you can skip support
  of FF, because last one does not support ES6 modules;
* Map with temperatures is not required for this task;
