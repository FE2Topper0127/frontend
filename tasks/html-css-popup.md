# HTML & CSS practice: Google-style Popup

The goal of this task is to practice coding HTML & CSS from mockup. You are expected to deepen your knowledge of HTML & CSS and discover new previously unknown features.

Requirements:
- no JavaScript, only HTML/CSS, use of preprocessors is allowed
- no external libraries or frameworks
- browser support: Chrome only (feel free to use latest features)

:warning: ![Google-Warning](https://place-hold.it/380x24/fff/f03c15?text=Important!+Google+may+ban+your+github+pages+domain!&bold)

The above may happen if you:
- use word "google" in
  - your project/repo name
  - any urls
  - in css selectors
  - in HTML elements ids (including created with JS) or elsewhere across HTML
- replicate Google design (layout structure, styles etc)
- use Google icons
   
Change pop-up layout and styling, use different icons (or tamper them in graphic editor) and service names, so that Google won't suspect you in attempt to mimic Google services and/or steal your visitors Google credentials.

The popup is expected to have three states depending on click on the Google App button (third element from left in the top row). After first click the popup appears. After second click it is hidden. When popup is visible, click on "More" button adds 10 more icons and forces the content of the popup to scroll.
Mobile view is irrelevant for this task.  
Initial state: non pop-up visible:

![popup-hidden](../img/popup-hidden.png)

Active state:

![popup-visible](../img/popup-visible.png)

Scrollable state:

![popup-scrollable](../img/popup-scrollable.png)

All interactive elements should be marked as such.

![popup-hover-state](../img/popup-hover.png)

All interactive elements should have `:focus` state.

You may want to publish your results on
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

**When complete do the following:**
1. You will require code review for this task:
   - If you are a **p2p course** student, please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-p2p/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - If you are a student of the **offline** Kottans course, please, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2019-homeworks/blob/master/README.md)
1. You did a lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `HTML-CSS-Popup — #done` (or `HTML-CSS-Popup — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
