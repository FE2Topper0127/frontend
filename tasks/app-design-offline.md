# Offline Web Applications (optional)

> Note: this task is optional because most likely, you will not use knowledge obtained from it during our course. But, you will need this information when you will work as a developer. At least a general understanding of the concept. That's why finishing this task is up to you.

[Offline Web Applications](https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)

do the following after you're done:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in the course
   and put the screenshots in `task_offline_web_app` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Offline Web Applications`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on the course
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did an extra effort! Go ahead
   share your progress with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Offline Web Apps — #done` (or `Offline Web Apps — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
