# Task 14

Pizza App: Canvas

### Pizza Creation
When pizza manager creates new order with single pizza we want to have a pretty preview to be shown to user.
In order to do it we're going to use [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

#### Key Terms
- canvas
- multipart/formdata
- sprites
- canvas context
- blob

#### Task Description

- Create new page pizza ordering page with two key components - drawing board and ordering form.
- Fill ordering form with [ingredients](https://github.com/lempiy/Kottans-Pizza-Api/blob/master/docs/INGREDIENT.md#list) 
and [tags](https://github.com/lempiy/Kottans-Pizza-Api/blob/master/docs/TAG.md#list) checkboxes.
- Your page structure may look similar(not equal!) to image bellow.
- Your draw board should display empty crust on page init. Canvas size - 320x320 pixels.
- Upon choosing some of ingredients, draw board should display the ingredient layer on crust.
- Upon discarding some of ingredients, draw board should remove the ingredient layer from crust.
- Upon changing size of the pizza, crust and ingredients size should change too.
- Upon submit all user data including canvas blob snapshot should be sent to [server](https://github.com/lempiy/Kottans-Pizza-Api/blob/master/docs/PIZZA.md#create-pizza).
- Form should include validation according to [API](https://github.com/lempiy/Kottans-Pizza-Api/blob/master/docs/PIZZA.md#create-pizza) requirements.
- Pizza total price should be count according to formula: 

`pizza.size / 5 + Î£(ingredient[n].price + ... +ingredient[n+ingredient.length-1].price)`

- Create pizza page should be secured with authorization permissions.
- Background of output pizza image should be transparent.
