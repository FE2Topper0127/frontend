# Git for Team Collaboration

Yeh, we know that it's Git again and you a bit tired of it.
But! It's a great new course. It'll help you a lot to understand better
the git and operate with it and you'll benefit from it on your future job
and projects!

 1. [What is Version Control](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)

 2. [GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)

Finish the courses (1) and (2) above.

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your finished lessons from (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_git_collaboration` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Git Collaboration`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Git Collaboration — #done` (or `Git Collaboration — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).
