# Git for Team Collaboration

Complete the following:

 1. [GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)
 
 2. Complete the following levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):
    - Main: Ramping Up, Moving Work Around
    - Remote: To Origin and Beyond
    
A **Mixed Bag** and **Advanced Topics** from the Main section
of **Learn Git Branching** are optional. If you skip those now
make sure to bookmark the resource and revert to it later
to improve your git skills.

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your finished lessons
   and put the screenshots in `task_git_collaboration` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Git Collaboration`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Git Collaboration — #done` (or `Git Collaboration — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).
