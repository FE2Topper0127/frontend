# Intro to HTML and CSS

1. [Intro to HTML & CSS (Eng)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304)

1. [Learn HTML(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

2. [Learn CSS(Eng)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your progress in (1) and (2)
   and put the screenshots in `task_html_css_intro` folder in
   your `kottans-frontend` repo
1. In your `kottans-frontend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Intro to HTML and CSS`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. Great job! Go ahead and share your progress with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Intro to HTML and CSS — #done` (or `Intro to HTML and CSS — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**

   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
