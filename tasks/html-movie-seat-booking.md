#### Skills to master in this lesson

Skill/Competence | Why shold I learn it? |
-----------------|-----------------------|
HTML5 semantic elements | HTML5 semantic element provide developers with rich possibilities to develop usable, accessible forms with good browser support |
Styling built-in elements | Native widgets may not match the design. also the look of a widget may differ between browsers. |
HTML5 validation | Many useful validations can be done with native HTML validation |

#### Task Description

Make an app close to the mockup: https://dribbble.com/shots/3628370-Movie-Seat-Booking

##### Acceptance criteria

- Use only HTML & CSS, no JavaScript. *CSS and HTML preprocessors allowed (SASS, LESS, Stylys, Pug, HAML, etc.)*
- Use semantic HTML elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>` etc. - this task's purpose is to showcase all the available options and make you familiar with them.
- Interractive elements should be clickable and respond to user action.
- If you use form, data should be validated using HTML/CSS capabilities only. 
- Interractive elements should be accessible via any type of input: mouse, keyboard, touch devices. Bonus points for testing with screen readers.
- Design up to you.
- Test the result in all available browsers & on different devices.  
- Project should be tested for valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) & [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 100% compliance is not required, but make sure you don't have errors (warnings are acceptable, just make sure you understand them).
