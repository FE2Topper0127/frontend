# Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

Learn some command line, server and http tools.

1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

  **Note:** Completion of free content (Interactive Lessons) is the required minimum, but Quizes and Freeform Projects should also be available via 7-day trial of Codecademy. Do them if you can, it's great practice.

   **A note for Windows users:** This course provides a virtual environment to
   type commands in. However, if you want to later use this commands in practice,
   you will need to work with Linux CLI as many commands are not supported by
   Windows `cmd` or PowerShell. You must have already installed `git`
   from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   It offers Git Bash that can be used to type bash commands in.

   Right click anywhere in file explorer and select
   `Git Bash here` option.
