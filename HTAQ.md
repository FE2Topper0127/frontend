# HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS
:heavy_exclamation_mark:**PLEASE READ FULLY**:heavy_exclamation_mark:
## INTRO
In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. This guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way more likely to get you a satisfactory answer.

**It sometimes looks like we're reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant. But this isn't really true. Please try to ask good questions :smile_cat:**
## General Structure Of The Question
_Follow one of these structures of the question, or replace it with a similar ones_
* I am doing ..... (task name)
* I want to... (achieve something, e.g. have an element on a web page to float above other elements)
* I tried this... (code fragment, or codepen with minimal yet sufficient code fragment to reproduce the issue)
* How do I....? / What did I miss?

## Before You Ask
Before asking a question, do the following:

1. If your question about course - [FAQ](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/faq.md).
2. If your question about tasks -  good sources will be our [chats](https://github.com/babayK0/frontend/blob/master/HTAQ.md#where-to-ask).
3. If question about JS or HTML/CSS - Web,[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org),etc.
4. Also you can find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
5. You're a programmer! So try to find an answer by reading the source code.

When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you're not being a lazy sponge and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers.

Take your time. Do not expect to be able to solve a complicated problem with a few seconds of Googling. Sit back, grab a cup of tea, relax and give the problem some thought before approaching experts. Trust us, they will be able to tell from your questions how much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help if you come prepared. Don't instantly fire your whole arsenal of questions just because your first search turned up no answers (or too many).

Prepare your question. Think it through. Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers, or none at all. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually get help.

**Remember, [there is no such thing as a stupid question.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_stupid_question)**:wink:

## When You Ask
* **Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language**
* **Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** 

    _There are many similar questions, so try [SEARCH](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=) first and then Ask._

* **Be precise and informative about your problem**

     Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
     
     Describe the environment in which it occurs (for example a browser).
     
     Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
     
     Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.

* **Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses**

* **Be explicit about your question**

### Front-End Specific Tools To Use
