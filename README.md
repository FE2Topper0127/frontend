Welcome

This course will contain basics of frontend, HTML, CSS, JS, and some frontend frameworks.

We plan to decrease the amount of lectures in favor of collective discussions, team projects & collective work.
And give all power & responsibility to students.
(You can use these materials for self-eductation too.)

#### Admission

Admission for the course is open until enough applicants have successfully completed the tasks (30 students approximately). Which means, that completing the tasks faster increases your chances to get into the course.

#### In the process of completing test tasks kottans will learn:

1. Git, github basics, writing good commit messages
2. Linux, command line basics, network basics
3. HTML, CSS
4. JS basics
5. Build a bunch of test projects
6. Have fun together

#### Syllabus:

0. Git, GitHub
1. HTML, CSS
2. JavaScript
3. Bootstrap
...
<!-- TODO finish it up  -->

# General requirements

0. English knowledge, most of the materials will be in English.

1. Repository on GitHub to save your progress. More on repositories in task 0 (see below).

2. Formatting: it's up to you, but remember to make it readable. Using [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) is a good idea.

3. Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answers to the following questions in your respective repo.  Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have learned.
  - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
  - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
  - name (at least) one thing you intend to use in the future

4. Online courses: finish all tasks, add some reflection about them in README.

5. Videos: same as for reading - watch the video, answer three questions.


# Task 0 (get familiar with Git and GitHub):

1. Finish the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

2. Finish [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

3. Create repository named "kottans_frontend".

4. Create README.md for the repository.

5. Describe your impressions about learned materials.

6. Send a pull-request to repo [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo) proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.
**Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.**

When you finish this task you can start the next one:

[Task 1](test01.md)

#### P.S. If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you‚Äôll spend a lot of time building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You‚Äôll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses like that (and we‚Äôll never stop).
