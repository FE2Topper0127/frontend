# General requirements

1. You will make a repository on GitHub and save your progress in it. More on repositories in task 0 (see below).

1. Styling: it's up to you, but remember to make it readable. Using [markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) is a good idea.

3. Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answers to the following questions in your respective repo.  Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have learned.
  - name (at least) one thing that was new to you
  - name (at least) one thing that surprised you
  - name (at least) one thing you will use in the future

4. Online courses: finish all tasks, make screenshots and post them in respective task's README.

5. Videos: same as for reading - watch the video, answer three questions.


# Task 0 (get familiar with Git and Github):

1. Watch [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

2. Read [sixrevisions.com/web-development/git-tips/](http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/git-tips/)

3. Finish the course [How to use Git and Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

4. Create repository named "kottans_web_test" and a folder "task_0" in that repository.

5. Create README.md for the repository.

6. Finish [learngitbranching](http://learngitbranching.js.org) and put the screenshots of completed task lists in the task_0 folder and add links to screenshots to the README.md file in the root of task_0 folder (you can read about markdown here: [writing-on-github](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/))

7. Send a pull-request to repo [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo) proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description. Take screenshot of the PR and post it in README to task_0 folder.
**Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.**

When you finish this task you can start the next one:

[Test 1 is not ready yet]()

#### P.S. If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that (and we’ll never stop).
