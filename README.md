# Front-End Course

The course contains basics of front-end development:
HTML, CSS, JS, and front-end frameworks.

We plan to decrease the amount of lectures in favor of collective discussions,
team projects & collective work. And give all power & responsibility
to students.

You can use these materials for self-eductation as well.


### Admission

Admission for the course is open until enough applicants have successfully
completed the tasks (approximately 30 students). Which means, that completing
the tasks faster increases your chances to get into the course.

If you have any questions you can ask us in the

### P.S. You should know

If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that
you‚Äôll spend a lot of time building something big together ‚Äî a new way
of learning and collaborating. You‚Äôll become part of a small family
and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this
friendship (as you should in any friendship).

Final task of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses
like that (and we‚Äôll never stop).

#### Our basic rules

* Respect each other.
* [There is no such thing as a stupid question][wiki-stupid-question].
* Each person learns with their own speed, has different background and
  personality, please respect this.
* Communicating and understanding people that are different from you
  can be beneficial to both parties, provided mutual respect.
* We are against any discriminations by gender, age, the color of skin,
  disabilities or any other.
* We respect intellectual property - there is hard work of an author
  or a group of authors behind all materials that we use.
