# Front-End Course

The course contains basics of front-end development:
HTML, CSS, JS, and front-end frameworks.

We plan to decrease the amount of lectures in favor of collective discussions,
team projects & collective work. And give all power & responsibility
to students.

You can use these materials for self-education as well.


### Admission

Admission for the main course was open until 13 Jan 2019 and now
is closed as the student's group is full and the course was started.
The only alternative for now - is our p2p course.

Since we would like to support ambitious students who couldn't join the main course,
we providing __peer-to-peer__ learning (hereinafter referred to as __p2p__) based on the online part
([Stage0](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/contents.md#stage-0-self-study)) of the main course.

A p2p group has no specific limitations on the number of students and not 
so fitted to strict deadlines as the main group is.

The common factor of Peer teaching is that knowledge is shared not by an 
instructor or other person of authority.
It‚Äôs all about people on the same level teaching each other what they 
know. __Learners Teaching Learners__. 

As you could understand from the context of p2p meaning - it is a great
possibility to grow up both as a student and teacher. Especially this course,
you will learn how to correctly check the other students job.

If you have any questions you can ask us in one of our chats.

### P.S. You should know

If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that
you‚Äôll spend a lot of time building something big together ‚Äî a new way
of learning and collaborating. You‚Äôll become part of a small family

friendship (as you should in any friendship).

Final task of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses
like that (and we‚Äôll never stop).
