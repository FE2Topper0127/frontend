# Task 0: Get familiar with Git and GitHub [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Kottans/frontend.svg)](https://gitter.im/Kottans/frontend?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

1. Finish the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

2. Finish [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

3. Create repository named `kottans_frontend`.

4. Create `README.md` for the repository.

5. Describe your impressions about learned materials.

6. Send a pull-request to repo [Kottans/mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo) proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description.
**Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.**

When you finish this task you can start [the next one](test01.md).

### P.S. You should know

If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together — a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses like that (and we’ll never stop).
