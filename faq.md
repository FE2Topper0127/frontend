**[Updated 15/10/18]**
- Q: When is course going to start?
  + A: No date set yet, but test assignments and program are being updated. As soon as we are done, we'll give time to complete tasks and will set up interview afterwards
- Q: Is this course available online?
  + A: No plans for this yet. Most tasks will be available online and we might put up some of the lecture recordings, so you could try working on this at your own pace and ask questions in the [chat]
- Q: Where are courses going to take place?
  + A: Probably, this will take place at [Cogniance office](https://goo.gl/maps/cVxLSCpWPUB2)
- Q: At what time are lectures gonna be?
  + A: Timetable is not set yet. Probably, one day on the weekend (historically, Saturdays were used for this), half a day
- Q: What is test task? When can I start doing it?
  + A: Well, tasks are already available through [this repo](https://github.com/kottans/frontend#ready), but some of the later tasks will be updated. You can start doing them now if you want to, but we can't guarantee they are the final tasks
- Q: I want to be a student, what do I do?
  + A: Great spirit takes you halfway there. You could start working through prerequisites and test tasks, keep an eye on our [public channel](https://twitter.com/kottans_org) and [chat]
- Q: I want to talk you your manager, get me to real person
  + A: We don't have one, but you could throw a question at the [chats](https://github.com/kottans/frontend#chats) and somebody might answer.

Once again, don't forget:
1) we are not paid to do this
2) answering same questions over and over takes time, that could be used to make materials for this course better
3) don't be rude, everyone likes talking to nice people
4) there's a person on the other end of the screen.

^_^ Knowledge must be shared
