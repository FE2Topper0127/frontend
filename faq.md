**[Updated 30/10/18]**
- Q: When the course is going to start? Any schedule?
  + A: The schedule is:
    * `29/10/18` - official launch, time to start with test tasks from **Stage 0. SelfStudy**
    * `05--15/01/19` - test tasks **Stage 0. SelfStudy** are expected to be completed; enrollment interviews held
    * `15/01/19` - **Stage 1. Meetup supported (intramural) phase** starts
- Q: Is this course available online?
  + A: No plans for this yet. Most tasks will be available online and we might put up some of the lecture recordings, so you could try working on this at your own pace and ask questions in the [chat]
- Q: Where are courses going to take place?
  + A: Probably, this will take place at [Cogniance office](https://goo.gl/maps/cVxLSCpWPUB2)
- Q: At what time are lectures gonna be?
  + A: Timetable is not set yet. Probably, one day on the weekend (historically, Saturdays were used for this), half a day
- Q: What is test task? When can I start doing it?
  + A: Tasks are already available through [this repo](https://github.com/kottans/frontend#ready).
- Q: I want to be a student, what do I do?
  + A: Great spirit takes you halfway there. You could start working through prerequisites and test tasks, keep an eye on our [public channel](https://twitter.com/kottans_org) and [chat]
- Q: I want to talk you your manager, get me to real person
  + A: We don't have one, but you could throw a question at the [chats](https://github.com/kottans/frontend#chats) and somebody might answer.

Once again, don't forget:
1) we are not paid to do this
2) answering same questions over and over takes time, that could be used to make materials for this course better
3) don't be rude, everyone likes talking to nice people
4) there's a person on the other end of the screen.

^_^ Knowledge must be shared
